## Features

- Branch conversations across agents, with a shared call primitive for subagents, handoffs and delegations.
- Edit agents and revisions, run deterministic evals, schedule work and inspect run traces.
- Apply tenant permissions, depth and fan-out limits, run admission policies and usage accounting.
- Search knowledge, manage project memory and inspect alerts and analytics in the web console.
- Connect GitHub and Slack through signed webhook ingress and tenant-bound connector capabilities.
- Answer in Slack with the console's own components through a Socket Mode app that streams natively.

**Early development:** platform records are in memory. Spend limits are recorded but not enforced. Approvals are tool calls and questions a run parks on; a run cannot yet park at a limit. Local accounts and per-project access are unfinished. GitHub and Slack integrations have simulated-API coverage; see the [integration trial guide](docs/integrations.md) and [status table](docs/architecture.md#status) for validation boundaries.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Go version from [`go.mod`](go.mod) | Build the server |
| Node.js 22.12+ or 24+, pnpm | Build the Vite console |
| Chrome/Chromium and [teasr](https://github.com/urmzd/teasr) | Optional screenshot capture |

The platform, console, shared UI and Slack renderers live in this repository. The Go libraries are published separately.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/urmzd/warp.git
cd warp
go mod download
pnpm install
```

A workspace answers through one or more [clients](docs/clients.md): a Slack app
or a GitHub installation, each with its own identity, secrets, agents and limits.
See the [integration trial guide](docs/integrations.md).

## Quick Start


Run the backend in one terminal:

```sh
make dev
```

Run the console in another terminal, from the repository root:

```sh
make web
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5173>, complete the first-run workspace form and select an example agent. The backend listens on `127.0.0.1:8080`. Seeded agents use fiber's offline provider, so the preview requires no model key.

Development auth grants admin access on loopback. For real sign-in, roles and machine tokens, follow [the security guide](docs/security.md). To use Anthropic, set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` before starting the server and configure an agent with provider `anthropic`.

### Capture the console

With a fresh `make dev` process and `make web` running:

```sh
teasr run
```

[`teasr.toml`](teasr.toml) captures the console pages and writes images to [`showcase/`](showcase/). The console opens directly after sign-in. Personal preferences are optional in Profile and Appearance settings.

## Conversations

`POST /api/runs` takes `agent`, `text`, and optionally `after` and `project`.

- Leave `agent` empty or `auto` and the platform picks: the agent whose name,
  description or prompt best matches the message, or the workspace's baseline.
- `after` names the turn the message follows. Naming a turn that already has a
  reply starts a branch. Any agent can answer any turn, and is sent the branch
  so far.

## API

The contract is [`api/openapi.yaml`](api/openapi.yaml): every route, its
permission, request and response, and the event stream. Tests fail when it and
the server disagree. [`packages/client`](packages/client) is a TypeScript client
generated from it. See [the API guide](docs/api.md).

| Route | Permission |
|-------|------------|
| `GET /api/me` | Signed in |
| `GET`, `POST /api/agents`, `PUT /api/agents/{name}`, `GET /api/agents/{name}/history` | `agents:read`, `agents:write` |
| `GET`, `POST /api/runs`, `GET /api/runs/{id}`, `/tree`, `/trace` | `runs:read`, `runs:write` |
| `GET /api/threads`, `GET /api/threads/{id}` | `runs:read` |
| `GET /api/pick?q=`, `GET`, `PUT /api/settings` | `agents:read`, `agents:write` |
| `GET`, `POST /api/evals`, `PUT`, `DELETE /api/evals/{name}`, `POST .../run`, `GET .../runs` | `evals:read`, `evals:write` |
| `GET`, `PUT /api/preferences`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE /api/preferences/photo` | Signed in, the caller's own |
| `POST /api/runs/{id}/calls` | `runs:write` |
| `GET /api/events?topic=agent[:name[:run]]` | `runs:read`, server-sent events |
| `GET /api/analytics?window=1h` | `runs:read` |
| `GET /api/journal?agent=&run=&kind=&origin=&q=&window=` | `runs:read` |
| `GET`, `POST /api/schedules`, `DELETE /api/schedules/{name}`, `POST .../pause`, `.../resume`, `.../run` | `schedules:read`, `schedules:write` |
| `GET /api/alerts`, `POST /api/alerts/{id}/ack`, `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE /api/alert-rules` | `alerts:read`, `alerts:write` |
| `GET`, `POST /api/knowledge`, `.../{name}/documents`, `GET /api/knowledge/search?q=` | `knowledge:read`, `knowledge:write` |

## Development

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Set up hooks and modules | `make init` |
| Format, lint and test | `make check` |
| Test with race detection | `make test` |
| Web typecheck and tests | `cd apps/web && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` |
| Shared adapter typecheck and tests | `cd packages/adapter && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` |
| Slack app lint, typecheck and tests | `cd apps/slack && pnpm exec biome check && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` |
| Regenerate the TypeScript client from the spec | `make client` |
| Client typecheck and tests | `make client-check` |
| Lint the API spec | `make spec-lint` |

## Product direction

Warp is a shared place for people and agents to organize projects and tasks, maintain a living knowledge base, and improve how they work together. Agents can be created and hired into scoped project roles. Policies govern capabilities, access, budgets and approvals; connectors bring work in and send updates out. People participate through assignments, questions, approvals and notifications. Shared abilities and agent instructions improve through evaluated, reviewed changes.

This is the direction, not a claim that every workflow exists today. See the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) and [implementation status](docs/architecture.md#status).

## Architecture

| Part | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Warp** | Shared workspace, project orchestration, API, console and presentation |
| [Saige](https://github.com/urmzd/saige) | Agent execution, tools, retrieval and evaluations |
| [Fiber](https://github.com/urmzd/fiber) | Messaging, connectors and request routing |
| [Playscape](https://github.com/urmzd/playscape) | Governed execution environments and workspace isolation |
| [Anchor](https://github.com/urmzd/anchor) | Durable execution, replay and recovery |

The `@warp/*` packages supply web and Slack presentation; `internal/presentation/github` renders GitHub Markdown. They live with the platform in this repository.


An agent-to-agent call creates a run through `pkg/call`; its edge determines access, budget, depth and delegation mode. The platform owns identity, storage and orchestration; warp owns rendering. Read the [architecture and implementation status](docs/architecture.md) before relying on planned persistence or governance features.
