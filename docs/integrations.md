# GitHub and Slack trial

Humagen owns [clients](clients.md) (which Slack apps and GitHub installations a
workspace answers through), agent definitions, review and command policy, and
the run history shown in its console. Fiber supplies signed
webhooks, API capabilities, routing and execution. Humagen `internal/presentation/github` supplies
the review and guide Markdown. The same repository contains the shared web and Slack components.

## Local setup

The external Go modules are pinned in `go.mod`, to released versions apart
from anchor's Postgres adapter, which has no release yet and is pinned to a
commit, so the server builds from this checkout alone. Use `go test ./... -race`
to verify the composition. Run `go run ./examples/github-review` for a token-free preview.

Provide `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `HUMAGEN_AGENT_MODEL` for a model available to
your Anthropic account. The example specs use the supported `anthropic` provider.
Startup replaces the `YOUR_MODEL_ID` placeholder using `HUMAGEN_AGENT_MODEL`.
An offline test is not evidence that a paid model has been exercised.

```sh
go run ./cmd/humagen serve -auth=dev -tenant=trial \
  -webhook-addr=127.0.0.1:8383 \
  -agent-specs=examples/github-review/agent.json,examples/github-review/fixer.json
# In another terminal:
make web
```

The console uses localhost:5173 and the API localhost:8080. External runs appear
on the same Runs page as console runs. The variables below create one default
client per surface in tenant `trial`. Only that tenant can see or use it;
inbound payloads cannot choose a tenant. Further clients, such as a second Slack
app that answers as another agent, are created through `POST /api/clients`. See
[clients](clients.md). Stores are in memory unless the server runs with
`-state=postgres`, the default when `HUMAGEN_POSTGRES_URL` is set.

Forward **only port 8383**, whose handler exposes signed webhook endpoints and
readiness. `/api`, `/auth` and the console are absent there. Never forward the
dev-auth console/API listener. Stop the forwarder and process after the trial.

## One credential item

Keep the GitHub, Slack and model credentials together in one 1Password Secure
Note named `Humagen integrations`, with concealed custom fields. Reuse an
existing item when one exists. Copy values through 1Password's UI or CLI input,
not command-line arguments, source files, terminal output or chat.

| Field | Runtime use |
|---|---|
| `anthropic_api_key` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `github_app_id`, `github_installation_id`, `github_private_key` | Mint a repository-scoped installation access token |
| `github_token` | `HUMAGEN_GITHUB_TOKEN`, a current installation token |
| `github_webhook_secret` | `HUMAGEN_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| `slack_bot_token` | `HUMAGEN_SLACK_TOKEN` |
| `slack_signing_secret` | `HUMAGEN_SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` |
| `slack_team_id`, `slack_bot_user_id` | Workspace and agent routing |

The server accepts a token per client; it does not yet mint or refresh GitHub installation
tokens. Refresh expired tokens before a trial. App IDs/private keys alone do
not configure the connector. Keep non-secret model, repository, bot mappings and
forwarding URLs alongside the item's instructions. No credentials were created
or consolidated by this migration; a live trial needs the actual item and targets.

Use 1Password `op run --env-file` with a local reference-only environment file:

```dotenv
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=op://Private/Humagen integrations/anthropic_api_key
HUMAGEN_GITHUB_TOKEN=op://Private/Humagen integrations/github_token
HUMAGEN_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=op://Private/Humagen integrations/github_webhook_secret
HUMAGEN_SLACK_TOKEN=op://Private/Humagen integrations/slack_bot_token
HUMAGEN_SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=op://Private/Humagen integrations/slack_signing_secret
```

Then start the command above through `op run --env-file=<local-reference-file> --`.
Do not commit that local file or capture the injected environment in logs.
The default clients record only the names of these variables, and only the
server's `-tenant` may reference them. A client created through the API can
reference a variable of its own only if the server was started with
`-secret-refs '<tenant>=HUMAGEN_NAME,...'` listing it for that tenant. With no
list, write the secret as a value. See [clients](clients.md#secrets).

## GitHub installation

Use GitHub's [manifest registration flow](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/sharing-github-apps/registering-a-github-app-from-a-manifest)
with [humagen's manifest](../examples/github-review/app-manifest.json).
Replace its app name, webhook URL and callback URL.

1. Submit JSON in the `manifest` form field to `https://github.com/settings/apps/new`,
   with random `state`. Organization apps use `/organizations/ORG/settings/apps/new`.
2. Validate the returned `state` before accepting the callback's `code`.
3. Within one hour, exchange the code through
   `POST https://api.github.com/app-manifests/{code}/conversions`.
4. Save the returned credentials into the consolidated 1Password item, preserving
   Slack/Anthropic fields, then install the app on the selected repository.

The callback receiver must keep credentials out of browser responses and logs.
The template's localhost callback is a placeholder, not a receiver started by
`humagen serve`. Registration callback and 1Password-writing automation are not
implemented here. The transcript's temporary setup page is not bundled, and its
passkey prompt does not establish that an app was created.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Webhook URL | Your forwarder's public URL, targeting `/connectors/github` on port 8383 |
| Events | `issues`, `issue_comment`, `pull_request`, `pull_request_review`, `pull_request_review_comment` |
| Review permissions | Issues write, Pull requests write, Checks write, Contents read, Metadata read |
| Optional fix/check permissions | Contents write and Actions write; Actions read for observing CI |

A public third-party relay such as smee receives the webhook payload. Use an
approved sandbox repository for a trial and relay only GitHub deliveries to the
GitHub endpoint. Slack URL verification requires a request/response-capable
forwarder, not a GitHub-style asynchronous relay.

```sh
export HUMAGEN_GITHUB_OWNERS='your-account'
export HUMAGEN_GITHUB_BOTS='your-app[bot]=github-agent'
export HUMAGEN_GITHUB_AUTO_LABELS='{"your-account/sandbox":{"agent:auto":"github-agent"}}'
export HUMAGEN_GITHUB_CHECKS=true
export HUMAGEN_GITHUB_GUIDES=true
```

Applying the configured label starts a review. Subsequent commits update its
guide and start separate reviews. Mention the app for questions. For writes,
map the app to `github-fixer`, update the label mapping accordingly, and enable
`HUMAGEN_GITHUB_MUTATIONS=true`. Only explicit `/fix` or `/check <run-id>`
requests from repository writers receive a run-bound grant. See [GitHub](github.md).

## Slack installation

Create or update the app using [the manifest](../examples/slack/manifest.json),
replace `YOUR_HOST` with the forwarder URL, install it, and invite its bot to the
trial channel. Configure the bot token/signing secret through the credential
item. Set `HUMAGEN_SLACK_TEAM`, `HUMAGEN_SLACK_BOTS` (bot-user-id=agent-name)
and `HUMAGEN_SLACK_DEFAULT_AGENT`. Team is required; a request for a team no
client serves is a 404. Set `HUMAGEN_SLACK_APP` to the app id when more than
one Slack app will be installed in the team.

`HUMAGEN_SLACK_SESSIONS=true` enables agent-session progress. Optional
`HUMAGEN_SLACK_COMMANDS` is a JSON array of command names, descriptions and
argument hints. Advertise only tasks supported by the chosen agent; registering
`create-pr` does not itself add a PR-creation tool. GitHub mutations cannot be
authorized by a Slack command. Cross-source GitHub reads require exact repository
grants in `HUMAGEN_GITHUB_READ_REPOSITORIES`.

Session and code-channel availability depends on Slack's workspace features.
Permanent feature/permission refusals are logged; normal threaded answers remain
usable. No code-channel creation or native streaming is advertised.
See [Slack](slack.md) for status/error behavior and the remaining limitations.

## Acceptance evidence

The automated suite checks signed ingress, routing to the right client among
several, isolation between workspaces, correct tenant visibility in the
console API, guide updates, distinct reviews, thread replies, atomic fix commits,
workflow reruns and pending states, and Slack lifecycle/command policy using
fake or in-process APIs. A live trial additionally needs a real bot reply, the
same run in the console, actual model usage, and observed GitHub/Slack status.
Do not call it live-validated until those results have been collected.
