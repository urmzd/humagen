# The warp spec

warp is configured in one language: versioned YAML documents (JSON works too)
of two kinds, each with one owner.

| Kind | Says | Owned by | Takes effect |
|------|------|----------|--------------|
| `System` | how and where warp runs: listeners, sign-in, stores, bus, files, limits, extensions | whoever runs the process: a laptop, compose, Helm values | at start |
| `Platform` | what one workspace offers: its models, tools, agents, Slack and GitHub, settings | that workspace's admins | at start, with the console building on it |

Both can live in one `warp.yaml`, separated by `---`, or in separate files.
Two commands use it. `warp start` runs the platform here; `warp deploy` runs it
where the System document's `deploy` slot says (here, a Docker Compose project,
or a Kubernetes cluster). Both read `-f PATH` (repeatable; a directory reads its
`*.yaml`, `*.yml` and `*.json`). With no `-f` they read `warp.yaml` from
`WARP_HOME`, else the user config directory, and `warp start` runs on defaults,
with example agents, if there is none. `warp setup` writes one by asking a few
questions.

`warp serve` is the command for a server: what the image, the chart and the
compose project run. It reads only the files `-f` names, seeds nothing, never
asks, and signs in with `oidc` unless a flag or a System document says
otherwise. A System document sets sign-in like any other field, so one that
leaves `auth` out is `dev`, which answers only on loopback; Platform documents
alone leave `serve` on `oidc`.

Four rules hold for every field:

1. **Every field has a working default.** No file is a running platform on a
   laptop: development sign-in on loopback, memory stores, files on disk.
2. **A secret is a reference, never a value.** A credential is written
   `{ref: env:NAME}`, `{ref: keychain:SERVICE/ACCOUNT}` or
   `{ref: op://VAULT/ITEM/FIELD}`, read when it is used and never stored. A bare
   string where a secret belongs is refused.
3. **Every replaceable part is a slot: `kind` plus a block named after it.**
   `kind: postgres` reads `postgres: {...}`. A program built on the `warp` package
   registers more kinds (`warp.WithKind`), and the file selects one by name
   with no other change. An unknown kind is an error listing the kinds the
   binary has. A choice is a file or an interface, never a fork.
4. **Unknown fields are errors**, with the document and path they are in.

Flags still work and win over the file, so `warp start -addr 127.0.0.1:9090`
needs no edit. `warp config check -f warp.yaml` validates without starting and
lists every `env:` reference the shell it runs in has not set; `warp config
print` writes the result with every default filled in.

### What the file owns

A Platform document is applied at every start, and is the floor the console
builds on:

- **Agents** in the file are created, or revised to the file's spec. An
  unchanged spec makes no new revision. An edit made in the console to an agent
  the file declares lasts until the next start. `auto` and `sme` are tags, so
  never an agent's name (`warp config check` refuses one written inline, the
  start one read from a file), and a new agent named like a handle a person
  in the workspace goes by fails the start with "a person goes by @dana", as
  the API answers 409.
- **Workspace** fields that are set are applied; fields left out stay as the
  console left them.
- **Projects** in the file are created, or taken over when the console made
  one by that name, parents first, and are managed by the file. A field the
  file sets is the file's, and the console cannot change it (409); a field
  it leaves out stays the console's. `workspace.instructions` are the
  workspace's own in the same way. An unchanged entry makes no new version.
  A project made in the console survives every start, and one that leaves
  the file stays, no longer managed, so it can be changed or deleted in the
  console again.
- **Agents in projects.** `workspace.agents` and a project's `agents` are
  what it turns on: `enable` adds platform agents here and below (`*` alone
  is every one), `allow`, when set, is the only agents that may run here and
  below, and `default` answers a message that tags no agent (an agent, or
  `auto` for `@auto`). Each list names agents in the file or the platform's
  own. Set, the three are the file's as a whole, and the console cannot
  change them. An agent's `project` is where it lives: available there and
  below, and nowhere else, so `*` never reaches it and enabling it adds
  nothing. A named default must be available where it is set. They are
  applied in this order: the workspace, the projects, the agents, then
  where each agent lives. A home that leaves the file stays.
  `workspace.baseline` is gone: a file that still sets it fails with
  "baseline is now workspace.agents.default".
- **Models and tools** exist only while the file declares them. A tool's
  pinned schemas are its acceptance; anything else stays pending.
- **GitHub** is a client managed by the file, read-only in the API.
- Nothing is deleted because it left the file.

### The Slack app

`surfaces.slack` runs the Slack app (`apps/slack`) beside the server as a
client of its API, restarting it when it exits. It needs Node.js on `PATH` and
`apps/slack` with its dependencies installed (`pnpm install`), found under the
working directory, beside the binary, or at `WARP_SLACK_APP_DIR`. The warp image
carries neither, so there the surface is logged as off and the server runs
without it.

The app is given its tokens, its workspace and warp's address, plus `PATH`,
`HOME`, `TMPDIR`, `TZ`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, the `NODE_OPTIONS`,
`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY` and proxy variables, and
`SLACK_BRANDING` and `SLACK_SOCKET_*`, when they are set. Nothing else of
warp's environment reaches it.

It calls warp's API with a credential for the server's sign-in. Under `dev` it
needs none. Under `oidc` or `mock` it needs `warp_client`: a machine client of
the identity provider, whose access tokens the app gets with client credentials
and renews as they expire, with the scopes [the API](api.md#authenticating-a-machine)
lists for a Slack surface. `warp_token` is a bearer token given as it is, for a
token that does not expire; set one or the other. A process cannot sign in
through Tailscale Serve, so `tailscale` sign-in refuses a Slack surface. A spec
that needs a credential and has none is refused when it is checked, and so is a
start whose `-auth` flag needs one the file does not give.

Model names are shared across the workspaces in one process: two workspaces
may declare the same model, but not two different ones under one name.

### Projects

The workspace is the root of a tree of projects, written `~` in the
console's addresses. Each entry of `workspace.projects` is one project:

| Field | Left out | Rule |
|-------|----------|------|
| `name` | required | the identity, never changed: letters, digits, spaces, dashes and underscores, starting with a letter or digit, at most 63, unique ignoring case |
| `title` | the name | what people see: one line, at most 80 characters |
| `description` | none | at most 500 characters |
| `kind` | `team` | `company`, `team` or `account`. A company project sits under the workspace or another company project, and there are at most 10. An account never sits under another account |
| `parent` | the workspace | another project in this file (`~` is the workspace), at most 4 levels below the workspace |
| `account` | none | `{customer, external_id, url}`, on an account project only. `url` is https |
| `instructions` | none | at most 4,000 characters, sent to every agent answering here and below |

`workspace.instructions`, at most 4,000 characters, are sent first, then each
project's down to the one a conversation is filed in. A later one wins, and a
turn is sent at most 8,000 characters of them: the farthest are left out
first, and the turn says which.

`warp config check` refuses a mistake with its path, such as
`workspace.projects[2].parent: "Feild" is not a project in this file`. A
parent must be in the same file, because one made only in the console cannot
be checked before start. A workspace has at most 100 projects, and the start
checks the file again against the projects the console made. A project's kind
and parent are fixed when it is created, so a file that names another kind or
parent for a project that already exists fails the start.

## Which level a knob lives at

| Concern | Level | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Listen address, public URL | System | belongs to the host |
| Sign-in and the identity provider | System | one per process |
| Stores, bus, files | System | where state lives is the operator's choice |
| Concurrency, depth and fan-out | System | protects the process |
| Variables a workspace may reference | System | the environment is the process's |
| Names people see | both | the deployment's, then each workspace's |
| Models and model policies | Platform | what the workspace's agents run on |
| MCP tools and pinned schemas | Platform | what its agents may touch |
| Agents | Platform | the workspace's own |
| Slack and GitHub | Platform | its identity on a surface |
| History | Platform | how it behaves |
| Project tree, kinds, instructions and which agents are available where | Platform | the workspace's own |
| Spend and run limits | Platform, in the console | versioned, scoped policies (`pkg/policy`) |

## Deploying it

`warp deploy` takes the same documents anywhere, so nobody writes compose files
or Helm values by hand:

| `deploy.kind` | What `warp deploy` does |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| `local` (the default) | `warp start` on this machine |
| `compose` | writes a Docker Compose project (warp, and Postgres when asked) and brings it up. Sign-in that only answers on loopback runs on the host's network, so it stays on this machine |
| `kubernetes` | installs the Helm chart warp carries, with the spec as its values, into the cluster the block names |

`warp deploy -o DIR` writes the project or the chart and values and stops, for
review or for GitOps (the Flux example in `deploy/flux` applies the same
chart). A secret never lands in a written file: an `env:` reference is passed
from the deploying shell's environment, and a `keychain:` or `op://` one is
read on this machine and handed to the target as a variable the written spec
references.

## Extending it

| Slot | Built in | A registered kind returns |
|------|----------|---------------------------|
| `system.blobs` | disk, memory, s3 | a `blob.Store` |
| `system.bus` | memory, redis | a `bus.Bus` |
| `system.extensions[]` | none | something with `Run(ctx) error`, run beside the server |
| `platform.models[]` | anthropic, openai, ollama | an `agentrt.ProviderFunc` |
| `platform.tools[]` | mcp | a `runtime.Catalog` |

`warp.WithKind(slot, name, factory)` registers one. The factory is given its
block as JSON and decodes it strictly itself, so its fields get the same
unknown-field errors as the built-ins'. Sign-in and stores are built in only,
for now.
