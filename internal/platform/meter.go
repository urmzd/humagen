// What runs spend, and what happens when they spend too much.
//
// The runtime reports every model call on the run's stream as usage.call, the
// moment saige reports it, with a key no other call shares. The platform's
// observer sees every event, so it sees these: each one is counted in the
// usage ledger under the run's place (its root's project and client, its own
// agent, the workspace), once by its key, and then the run and its scopes are
// judged.
//
//   - A scope at its warning threshold raises one budget alert and one inbox
//     message, which stay until someone settles them.
//   - A scope at its spend or token limit stops the run that just spent,
//     through the runtime, with a reason naming the limit and the policy
//     version. Every other run in the scope is stopped at its own next call.
//   - A run with a lease is stopped once it has spent the lease.
//
// When a run ends, its own total as the runtime recorded it is settled in the
// ledger, which adds only calls whose events were missed, and the run's
// spend is settled with whatever called it.
//
// Money is held against a limit only when it is in US dollars. A call saige
// could not price, and money in any other currency, is never counted as zero
// spend: it is counted apart (unpriced calls, other costs), every scope with
// a spend limit it falls under gets one alert saying its spend is a lower
// bound, and its tokens count against MaxTokens, which is the limit that
// holds whatever the price.
