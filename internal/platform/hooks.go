// Housekeeping the platform does around a conversation, by asking an agent.
//
// A workspace can name an agent to title conversations and an agent to keep
// each agent's memory. After a turn ends, the platform sends that agent a
// request of its own, as a run with origin "system", and files the answer when
// it comes back. They are ordinary runs: they show on the Runs page, they are
// traced, and they can fail without affecting the conversation they serve.
//
// Both are off until a workspace chooses an agent for them, and neither runs on
// the offline provider, whose answer is a notice and not a title or a fact.
