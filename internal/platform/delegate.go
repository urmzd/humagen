// Agents calling agents.
//
// Every run belongs to one origin: the run a person, a schedule or a trigger
// started. Under it runs nest as deep as the limits allow, and each one a run
// calls is a run in its own right, with an id, a stream and a record.
//
// A called run has one of two lifetimes, chosen when the call is made.
//
// Attached: the caller asked and is waiting for the answer. The run lives
// inside its caller's lifetime. The caller is not done until it is, and if
// the caller fails or is stopped, it is stopped too, and so is everything
// attached to it in turn. An agent attaches another by tagging it.
//
// Delegated: the caller handed work over and carried on. The run's lifetime is
// its own. It finishes whatever becomes of its caller, and its answer goes to
// the inbox, because the caller may be gone by then. What it attaches dies
// with it, not with whoever delegated to it.
//
// Stopping is the runtime's. A stop is a request published on the bus, which
// the attempt executing the run hears: the model call in flight is cancelled,
// the turn wraps up with what it had said, and the run ends with
// lifecycle.stopped. Until that event arrives the run is stopping, and from
// the moment it is asked it can start no further calls. A run whose turn
// finished before the request reached it ends as it would have, and is never
// reported stopped. Everything attached to a stopped run is asked to stop with
// it, through the runtime, all the way down.

// wait. An agent has it only if its spec names it, and may only name agents
// in its spawn allowlist.
