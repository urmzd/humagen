// waits, and the first answer recorded is the answer. The platform owns who
// is asked and where: each question becomes one inbox message, addressed to
// the people who may answer it and to nobody else, and answering it there,
// on the run, or in Slack, is one call to the runtime.
//
// Who may answer is the runtime's rule, decided from the run's pinned
// revision: approvers or answerers when the spec names them, else anyone in
// the workspace, and never the person whose request raised a call they are
// asked to approve unless the spec allows self-approval. The platform
// addresses the message by the same rule, so a question lands only where it
// can be answered, and checks it again before it asks the runtime. A role in
