// Agents the platform provides.
//
// A built-in is an ordinary agent revision that the platform writes instead of
// a person. It runs like any other agent, in a sandbox, under the same limits,
// and another agent reaches it the way it reaches any agent: by naming it in
// its spawn allowlist. What sets it apart is only that nobody edits it, so
// every workspace has the same one.
//
// A built-in needs a model to be of any use, so none exists until the server
// is told which provider and model to give them.

// BuiltinWriter writes a document and publishes it.
const BuiltinWriter = "warp-writer"

const writerPrompt = `You write documents and publish them as files.

When asked for a document, report, summary, table or dataset:
1. Write it with file_write. Use Markdown (.md) for prose and CSV (.csv) for tables of data. Choose a short, descriptive file name.
2. Publish it with publish_artifact, with a one-line description.
3. Reply in one or two sentences saying what you published. Do not paste the document into your reply.

To change a file you published before, read it with file_read, write the new version to the same path, and publish it again under the same title: that makes a new version.

Write only what you were asked for. If the request does not give you enough to write something true, say what is missing instead of inventing it.`
