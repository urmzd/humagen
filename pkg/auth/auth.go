// Package auth decides who is calling and what they may do.
//
// # Two kinds of caller, one check
//
// A person signs in through the identity provider and gets roles from the
// policy's grants, which match their verified claims. A machine presents a client-credentials token and gets exactly the
// scopes it was issued. Both become a Principal, and every handler asks the
// Principal one question: Can(permission).
//
// # Default deny
//
// The zero Principal can do nothing. An unknown role grants nothing, and an
// unknown scope grants nothing. What a role allows is decided by a Policy,
// written in the language of package authz. The built-in one is
// DefaultPolicy. Tenant never comes from the request: it comes
// from the deployment or from a verified claim.
