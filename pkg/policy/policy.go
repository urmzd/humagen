// Package policy decides whether a run may start, given the limits a workspace
// has set and what has already been used.
//
// A policy belongs to a scope: the whole tenant, one project, one agent, or one
// client (a Slack or GitHub installation that raises runs). A run is checked against every policy whose scope it falls in, and the
// strictest answer wins, so a narrower policy can tighten what applies but can
// never loosen it.
//
// # One pure decision
//
// Decide takes the policies, the usage counted against each, and the request,
// and returns a Decision. It reads no clock and does no I/O, so every rule here
// is tested as a table, and the same inputs always give the same answer. The
// caller supplies usage for each policy's own period, which PeriodStart makes a
// pure function of the time.
//
// # What is metered
//
// Runs started in the period and runs in flight are counted exactly. Spend is
// what the runtime priced in US dollars, in micro-USD, from saige's catalog.
// A model call with no price, or priced in another currency, cannot be held
// against a dollar limit: it is counted in Usage.UnpricedCalls or
// Usage.OtherCosts and never as zero spend silently, and its tokens count
// against MaxTokens, which bounds every call whether it is priced or not.
