// Package pick is what @auto, the built-in router, runs: it chooses which of
// the agents available in a place should answer a message.
//
// It is lexical and explainable on purpose: an agent is picked because words
// in the message appear in its name, its description or its prompt, and the
// pick says which words. Rare words count for more than common ones.
//
// A description is optional. It works the way a skill's description does: a
// line or two written to be found by, so its words count for more than the
// same words buried in a long prompt. An agent with no description is still
// found through its prompt. When nothing matches, or two agents match
// equally, the fallback answers: the nearest default on the place's chain
// that names an agent rather than @auto. The pick says that too. With no
// fallback nothing is picked, and the person tags an agent. No model is
// asked, so the same message always goes to the same agent and anyone can see
// why.
